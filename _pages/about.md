Zehuai Lin is a master's student at the School of Astronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University in China, studying under Associate Professor Yan Binbin from the Flight Control Research Institute. His research interests include the **design, modeling, and control of new-concept aircraft, intelligent vehicles, and robots**. Additionally, he is very optimistic about the development of eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing), drone swarms, and related technologies, and holds a positive outlook on the growth of the low-altitude economy.

In 2018, Lin was admitted to the School of Electronic and Control Engineering at Chang'an University in China, where he pursued a bachelor's degree in Automation. During his undergraduate studies, he focused on courses such as Principles of Automatic Control, Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Vision, Electronic Circuits, and Mechanical Drawing, gaining knowledge in software, hardware, and mechanical structures. Starting from his freshman year, he joined the robotics club, engaging in two and a half years of practical learning with robots and intelligent vehicles, and led teams to participate in various academic competitions. Ultimately, he graduated with excellent academic performance **(Top 5%)** and extensive competition experience, earning a recommendation for exemption from the entrance exam for graduate studies.

Subsequently, Lin was recommended to the School of Astronautics at Northwestern Polytechnical University to pursue a master's degree in Control Engineering. He focused on courses such as Overall Design of Aircraft, Nonlinear Control Systems, Applications of Artificial Intelligence, and State Estimation and Autonomous Navigation of Robotic Systems, with his main research direction being aircraft guidance and control. While participating in academic competitions and research projects, he continued to maintain excellent grades **(Top 5%)**. He is expected to graduate in April 2025.

Lin has currently authored 6 papers and 1 patent as the first author, co-first, or first student author. Additionally, he has written 2 papers as the second author. As a team leader, he has won nine provincial or higher-level academic competition awards and has led three research projects.

He welcomes emails from fellow students for communication and mutual progress and kindly requests guidance and feedback from experts.
