Zehuai Lin is a master's student at the School of Astronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University in China, studying under Associate Professor Yan Binbin from the Flight Control Research Institute. His research interests include the design, modeling, and control methods of new-concept aircraft, intelligent vehicles, and robots. Additionally, he is very optimistic about the development of eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing), drone swarms, and related technologies, and holds a positive outlook on the growth of the low-altitude economy.

In 2018, Lin was admitted to the School of Electronic and Control Engineering at [Chang'an University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27an_University) in China, where he pursued a bachelor's degree in Automation. During his undergraduate studies, he focused on courses such as Principles of Automatic Control, Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Vision, Electronic Circuits, and Mechanical Drawing, gaining knowledge in software, hardware, and mechanical structures. Starting from his freshman year, he joined the robotics club, engaging in two and a half years of practical learning with robots and intelligent vehicles, and led teams to participate in various academic competitions multiple times. Ultimately, he graduated with excellent academic performance (Top 5%) and extensive competition experience, earning a recommendation for exemption from the entrance exam for graduate studies.

Subsequently, Lin was recommended to the School of Astronautics at [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_Polytechnical_University), where he pursued a master's degree in Control Engineering. He focused on courses such as Overall Design of Aircraft, Nonlinear Control Systems, Applications of Artificial Intelligence, and State Estimation and Autonomous Navigation of Robotic Systems. While participating in academic competitions and research projects, he continued to maintain outstanding grades (Top 5%). He is expected to graduate in April 2025.

Lin has currently authored six papers as the first author, co-author, or first student author. Additionally, he has written two papers and one patent as the second author. As the team leader, he has won nine provincial or higher-level academic competition awards and has led three research projects.

He welcomes emails from fellow students for communication and mutual progress and kindly requests guidance and feedback from experts.



Lin received a BEng degree in Automation from Chang'an University, Xi'an, China, in 2018. He is currently enrolled in the School of Astronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University, where he is pursuing a master's degree in Control Engineering. His main research interests are the design, modeling and control of flying vehicles and intelligent vehicles, and his work direction also includes the design and simulation of guidance algorithms for flying vehicles. He has published some papers in related fields, led more than 10 academic competitions and presided over 3 research projects, and has dabbled in algorithms, circuit hardware, and mechanical structures. He is very interested in manned vehicles, especially evtol, and is very optimistic about the future development of "low altitude economy".

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
